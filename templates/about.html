  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;<div class="container"> Steel Edu is a platform that provides the regions that an iron and steel producing company can target
  to sell its units throught the India. It is a single platform that the iron and steel producting companies can use to increase 
  their profit and sells. This is a prediction based platform that compiles different factors together to predict the real 
  consumption ratio of a state or a region, providing the companies a chance to sell there products as per the requirements.

    106.5 tonnes (MT), 4.9% increase from 101.5 MT in 2017, means that India overtook Japan as the world's second largest steel 
    production country. Japan produced 104.3 MT in year 2018, decrease of 0.3% compared to
